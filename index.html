              <p>
                The simple code in the page allows you to try out
                what a one-dimensional version of Conway's Game of Life would be like.
                Except you pick your own rules.
                Each cell is either alive or dead (on/off, 1/0, High/low), and
                its transition will depend on whether its neighbours are alive/dead.
                <br>
                <br>
                At every period, all cells will move to their next state, producing
                interesting patterns.
              </p>

              <p>
                Play with it and see what you can make :)

              <h5>About the Game of Life</h5>
              <p>
                The <a href='http://www.math.com/students/wonders/life/life.html'>Game of Life</a> is particularly well known among geeks. It's a zero-player game,
                where once the initial conditions are set, the destiny of all things will naturally unfold.
                <br>And the player does nothing about it... well, except set the initial conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                This seemingly trivial concept was invented by no other than <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann'>John von Neunmann</a>
                who was thinking about self-replicating robots. These would have to go through 26 states of construction before finishing their replication.
                <br>
                When he realized the complexity of the task, he sort-of gave up.
                <br>
                Instead, he took up the work of one of his colleges in crystal growth, as crystals grow outwards in a
                periodic pattern, they were far-simplified analogues of replicating robots (as it is also a self-replicating pattern).
                <br>The different possible molecules mapped to the different possible states.<br>
                The final result of their work was <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automata'>Cellular Automata</a>,
                the idea that individual "cells" would be affected by their immediate neighbours to change state, and it
                ended up being a very interesting computational mode.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then Conway came along and popularized the concept with <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life'>The Game Of Life</a>.
                <br>A simple set of rules on how to treat cells of a matrix could result in dynamic and complex behaviours.
              </p>
              <p>
                The last brilliant player in the understanding of this construct was <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram'>Stephen Wolfram</a>.
                <br>
                He proved that the simplest for of this construct, a one-dimensional line
                of 'cells' were capable of being programmed...<br>
                To do anything. <a href='http://www.cs.may.ie/~tnaughton/abc/download/dw15.pdf'>Anything at all</a>.
                <br>
                This property known as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness'>Turing Completeness</a>
                makes for a very mind-blowing concept.
                <br>8 simple rules are enough to construct a Turing complete machine...
                (with a little exponential overhead, of course).
                <br>This is effectively a machine capable of solving any problem any computer has ever solved.
              </p>

              <h5>iGEM</h5>
              <p>
                During an iGem competition, a team of smart Concordian biologists tried to replicate this idea with real cells.
              </p>
              <p>
                I tried helping them out by creating a simple prototype of protein synthesis and decay for the
                <a href='http://2013.igem.org/Main_Page'>iGEM competition of 2013</a>
              </p>

              <p>
                The idea was to bring the game of life to real live cells. The cells wouldn't live or die but would signal
                their state to neighbour cells using protein synthesis.
              </p>
              <p>
                The time it took for the protein to decay to a small enough level was basically the clock in the
                real-life game of life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because the proteins were not restricted to only communicate with their neighbours, they had to create two
                different set of cells
              </p>

            <p>
              <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerhead_ribozyme'>Hammerhead ribozymes</a> are very neat little catalytic RNA that are capable of
              performing functions much like proteins. Specifically, they are good at killing other
              RNA. That means that they can be used to "silence" gene expression.
              They are, however, tediously difficult and meticulous to design.
              So we (along with my <a href='https://github.com/anas-ambri/'>partner in crime</a>) helped out a prof make
              his life easier <a href='http://www.drkharma.com/ribosoft/'>here</a>.

            <h4>Using Genetic Algorithms to <a href='ages/index.html'>evolve chess playing</a> algorithms</h4>
            <p>
              Every chess player knows a pawn is worth less than a bishop. They would gladly sacrifice a rook for queen too. But would they sacrifice two of them? Would they sacrifice all their pawns for a queen? Sure, it might be circumstantial, but how much are pieces worth
              is a non-trivial matter when it comes to playing chess, and specially when making computers play chess since that is how they evaluate a good move. However, if experts can't agree on the worth of pieces, what worth should a computer program use?
              <br>Well, it can figure that out on its own using a genetic algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can find the details in the project linked above, including my <a href='ages/Paper.pdf'>report</a> on the matter.
            </p>
            <p>Let's talk about motivation:</p>
            <p>
              In Uni, I start many semesters scared to see my scheduled classes. <br>
              The names are daunting:<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital-system design<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signal and System Analysis<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applied Semi-conductor Theory<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real-time systems<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applied Genetic Evolutionary Systems (AGES)<br>
              <br>
              I walk into class wondering what it will be like. The name sounding like something far too
              complex for me to grasp in the mere space of 4 months. In which my attention will be divided across
              3 other classes, extra-curriculars, part-time work, etc...<br>
              But as the class progresses, the mystique and profound names lose their strange mists and
              emerge as simple, clever concepts designed on the shoulder of giants. <br>
              <br>This was AGES. <br>
              <br>
              The name is simply a nice acronym for Genetic Algorithms, that makes it sound even more fancy, <br>
              much more that it actually is.<br>
              Or maybe because it literally takes AGES to get a result.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              Either way, it does not matter.<br>
              <br>
              We take a problem and find a novel approach of tackling it. This is the essence of engineering.

            <h4>Using <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform'>DFFT</a> to reverse engineer a musical piece</h4>
            <p>
              Fancy acronyms and stuff... Really, all I was doing was writing a program that read some music file using a <a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/FourierTransforms.html'>powerful framework</a> to attempt
              to create the corresponding musical sheet.
            </p>
            <p>I guess I am jumping the gun. Context first: <a href='http://www.y-hack.com/'>YHack </a></p>
            <p>
              Y not? <br />
              I cannot conceive why any sane programmer would not like to go to one of these neat competitions, to meet like-minded people,
              sleep close to nothing, write the hackiest code they can come up with, get awesome swag, curse at infinite loops at 4 A.M., eat junk food and <a href='http://blisshabits.com/2012/05/what-sleep-deprivation-taught-me-about-joy/'>laugh maniacally</a> due to <a href='http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/sleep-leave-laughing/story?id=13250606'>sleep deprivation</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              OK, there might be reasons why not to embark in such an exhausting, yet entertaining idea, but the tight delivery of a product within a strict
              deadline and the necessity evaluate risks and trade-offs on a (very) short notice is an experience every developer ought to try.
              <br />
              I suppose the real reason I am providing context is as a form of disclaimer to some pretty ugly code I created in the short span of 24 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leaving that aside, the idea is really quite simple. Using a song's samples, grab chunks of a couple of milliseconds in length (call it meta-sample) and then do some mathemagic (known as Fourier Transforms). <br />
              What you get from this small process are a series of points that represent the frequencies that are in your meta-sample. <br />
              Sure, there are technical details such as sampling rate, and complex numbers and all kinds of things no one reading this really cares about,
              but in the end, all I did was take the series and figure out which frequency seemed strongest and then figured out what note was represented by that frequency.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do that over and over again, keep track of how many meta-samples the note was played and you start
              getting an idea of what the music sheet ought to have been. Sorta...
            </p>
            <p>
              There are considerations to make, which are much more difficult than they originally sound. For instance, what if there are multiple notes, and maybe multiple instruments? Well, the answer depends on how loud those other notes/instruments are and so on, but
              in short, it could handle a single "entity" playing more than one note at a time.
              <br /> The use of the word "entity" is due to the fact that a violin section would probably be interpreted well, but it is technically more than one instrument.
            </p>

            <p>
              The result was reasonable, as my teammate <a href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/jjwhatley'>Josh</a> got this neat <a href='http://www.musicxml-viewer.com/features/basic-usage/basic-usage.html'>music sheet API </a> working I got Mathematica operating with C# (though disappointed at the lack of code doc) and the other two players had fun making a cube turning around in HTML5.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, we were attempting to turning this into a web service and due to
              technical difficulties with providers and etc. we ended having a nice front-end and a nice back-end that just did not communicate...
            </p>
            <p>
              In retrospect, we should have showed the judges just the back end, but then again,
              that is why it is said that hindsight is 20/20.
            </p>
            <p>Well, that re-iterated the hard earned rule. Never underestimate integration. Also,  never underestimate integration. Have I mentioned that before?</p>
