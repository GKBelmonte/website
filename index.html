          <p>Hi there! My name is Gabriel Belmonte. I am a fourth (final) year Computer Engineering
          at Concordia University. This is where I will create my website when school,
          and side projects give me the change to execute this awesome task :) </p>

          <h4> Conway's <a href='Conway/index.html'>Game of Life</a>! </h4>
          <p>The simple code in the page allows you to try out
          what a one-dimensional version of Conway's Game of Life would be like.
          Except you pick your own rules.
          Each cell is either alive or dead (on/off, 1/0, High/low), and
          its transition will depend on whether its neighbours are alive/dead.
          <br>
          <br>
          At every period, all cells will move to their next state, producing
          interesting patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Play with it and see what you can make :)
          </p>
          
          <p>(also see <a href='Conway/explore/index.html'>this one</a> for an explorative version)</p>
          <h5>About the Game of Life</h5>
          <p>The <a href='http://www.math.com/students/wonders/life/life.html'>Game of Life</a> is particularly well known among geeks. It's a zero-player game,
          where once the initial conditions are set, the destiny of all things will naturally unfold. 
          <br>And the player does nothing about it... well, except set the initial conditions.</p>
          <p>This seemingly trivial concept was invented by no other than <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann'>John von Neunmann</a>
           who was thinking about self-replicating robots. These would have to go through 26 states of construction before finishing their replication.
           <br>
           When he realized the complexity of the task, he sort-of gave up.
           <br>
           Instead, he took up the work of one of his colleges in crystal growth, as crystals grow outwards in a
           periodic pattern, they were far-simplified analogues of replicating robots (also in some repeating pattern).
           <br>The different possible molecules mapped to the different possible states.<br>
           The final result of their work was <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automata'>Cellular Automata</a>,
           the idea that individual "cells" would be affected by their immediate neighbours to change state.           
          </p>
          <p>
            Then Conway came along and popularized the concept with <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life'>The Game Of Life</a>.
            <br>A simple set of rules resulting in dynamic and complex behaviours.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last brilliant player in the discovery of this construct was <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram'>Stephen Wolfram</a>.
            <br>
            He proved that the simples for of this construct, a one-dimensional line
            of 'cells' were capable of being programmed...<br>
            To do anything. <a href='http://www.cs.may.ie/~tnaughton/abc/download/dw15.pdf'>Anything at all</a>.
            <br>
            This property known as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness'>Turing Completeness</a> 
            makes for a very mind-blowing concept. 
            <br>8 simple rules are enough to construct a Turing complete machine...
            (with a little exponential overhead, of course)

          <p> 
            <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerhead_ribozyme'>Hammerhead ribozymes</a> are very neat little catalytic RNA that are capable of 
            performing functions much like proteins. Specifically, they are good at killing other
            RNA. That means that they can be used to "silence" gene expression.
            They are, however, tediously difficult and meticulous to design.
            So we (along with my <a href='https://github.com/anas-ambri/'>partner in crime</a>) helped out a prof make
            his life easier <a href='http://www.drkharma.com/ribosoft/'>here</a>.

          <p>Let's talk about motivation instead:</p>
          <p>
            In Uni, I walk into many semesters scared to see my schedule. <br>
            The names are daunting:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital-system design<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signal and System Analysis<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applied Semi-conductor Theory<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real-time systems<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applied Genetic Evolutionary Systems (AGES)<br>
            <br>
            I walk into class wandering what it will be like. The name sounding like something far too
            complex for me to grasp in the mere space of 4 months. In which my attention will be divided across
            3 other classes, extra-curriculars, part-time work, etc...<br>
            But as the class progresses, the mystique and profound names lose their strange mists and 
            emerge as simple, clever concepts designed on the shoulder of giants. <br>
            <br>This was AGES. <br>
            <br>
            The name is simply a nice acronym for Genetic Algorithms, that makes it sound even more fancy, <br>
            much more that it actually is.<br>
            Or maybe because it literally takes AGES to get a result.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Either way, it does not matter.<br>
            <br>
            We take a problem and find a novel approach of tackling it. This is the essence of engineering.
